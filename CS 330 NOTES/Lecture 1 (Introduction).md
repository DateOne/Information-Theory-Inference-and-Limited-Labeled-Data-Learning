### Why I care about multi-task learning and meta-learning
1. Some of Finn's work focuses on robots, so why robots: must generalize across tasks; need common sense understanding; 
supervision can't be taken for granted;
2. problem is exhaustive supervision, and it's not just a problem with reinforcement learning and robotics;
3. machines are specialists, and human are generalists;
4. large diverse data leads to broad generalization through deep learning;
5. unbalanced data and few data; 
6. by leveraging prior experience, quickly learn something new;

### What is a task?
1. critical assumption: different tasks need to share some structure;

### Informal problem definitions
1. multi-task learning and meta-learning problem;

### Why now?
1. past research: multitask learning (Caruana, 97; goal is to improve generalization performance, shared representation, 
inductive bias); Is learning the n-th thing any easier than learning the first? (when faced with a new thing to learn, 
humans can usually exploit enormous amount of training data and experiences that stem from other related learning tasks);
on the optimization of a synaptic learning rule (use standard optimization methods to select appropriate parameters for a 
give type of task);
2. modern research: how transferable are features in a deep neural network; an overview of multi-task learning in neural 
networks.
